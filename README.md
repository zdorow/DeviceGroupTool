# DeviceGroupTool
This is a java program that uses Jamf Pro API calls to collect information about device groups.

Windows: to run it simply unzip and click the shortcut, or find the .jar in the dist folder.
MacOS: Unzip then go to the dist/MobileDeviceTool.jar and double click.
Linux: Has not been tested in linux, however if you have the most recent versions of the JRE and JDK then it should run the same as in MacOS. It does require a GUI.
