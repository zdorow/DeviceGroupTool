# DeviceGroupTool
This is a java program that uses Jamf Pro API calls to collect information about device groups.

To run it simply type java -jar /FILEPATH TO JAR in cmd or terminal. There are windows and mac versions. Has yet to be tested on Linux, however if has the most recent JRE and JDK then it should run just fine with the mac version.
