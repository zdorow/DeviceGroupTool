# DeviceGroupTool
This is a java program that uses Jamf Pro API calls to collect information about device groups. It can be run on any computer that can access Jamf Pro from their web browser. It makes the text file inside the folder it was run in. 

Requirements: JDK and JRE (Written in version 1.8)

Windows/MacOS: Unzip then go to /dist/MobileDeviceTool.jar and double click.

Linux: Has not been tested in linux, however if you have the most recent versions of the JRE and JDK then it should run fine. It does require a GUI. If the demand is there it could be converted to a script.
